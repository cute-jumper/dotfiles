#+TITLE: Dotfiles

Home of dotfiles except Emacs configs. Managed by [[https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/][GNU Stow]].

I'm an Emacs user so dotfiles in this repo are really simple and thus should be
of little use for others.

* Modules
  - zsh. Use [[https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/][oh-my-zsh]].
  - Vim && ideavim. Make insert mode behave like Emacs.
  - Keysnail.
  - Git.
  - Hunspell.
  - latexmk.
